# BetterMap
A Better Map for Wurm Unlimited

- **BetterMap Features:**
  - Higher resolution isometric server map
  - Map window is resizable and location/size is saved between game sessions
  - Map is zoomable (scroll wheel) and dragable (right click + drag)
  - Provides markers for Start Towns, Deeds and Soulfall Stones with names displayed on mouseover
 
 - **Installation**
   - Needs Ago's Client ModLauncher installed.
   - Needs Ago's ServerPack Client mod.
   - Extract bettermap-x.x.zip into WurmLauncher directory.

- **Starting BetterMap**
  - BetterMap can be toggled on/off from the Main Menu (esc)
  - Bettermap can be toggled  on/off with the console command _bettermap toggle_
  - BetterMap toggle can be bound to a key with _bind (key) "bettermap toggle"_. For example: _bind m "bettermap toggle"_ to bind to the M key
  
- **Map Loading**
  - If BetterMap is opened prior to the serverpack being downloaded you will get a "Missing Image" screen. Simply close and reopen the BetterMap after the serverpack is downloaded and the map should reload itself. This *should* also work on server crossings, but that has not been tested at this time.
