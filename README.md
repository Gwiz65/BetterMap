  - BetterMap toggle can be bound to a key with _bind (key) "bettermap toggle"_. For example: _bind m "bettermap toggle"_ to bind to the M key
  
- **Map Loading**
  - If BetterMap is opened prior to the serverpack being downloaded you will get a "Missing Image" screen. Simply close and reopen the BetterMap window after the serverpack is downloaded and the map should load itself.
  - On server crossings, closing and reopening the BetterMap window after the new serverpack has been downloaded *should* load the new map . This has not been tested.
